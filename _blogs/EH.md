Understanding Economics from a Historical Perspective (especialy by Cliometrics), and comparison with History of Economic Thought.

**Cliometrics** is the application of economic theory and quantitative methods to the study of economic history.

Douglass C. North and Robert W. Fogel

Three major important questions in economics:
1. Why are some regions poor while others are rich?
2. Why didn't development occur before: the Malthusian trap
3. Why is development sustained now: the origin of modern growth

1. Why is Africa Poor?

> Nunn(QJE, 2008):  
> Africa's current underdevelopment can be explained by its slave trades.

> Nunn&Wantchekon(AER, 2011):  
> Individuals whose ancestors were heavily raided during the slave trade are less trusting today.  
> Most of the impact of the slave trade is through factors that are internal to the individual, such as cultural norms, beliefs, and values.

> Nunn&Puga(RES, 2012):  
> Rugged terrain hinders trade and most productive activities.  
> Rugged terrain within Africa afforded protection to those being raided during the slave trades.

2. Escape from the Malthusian trap

> Chatterjee&Vogl(AER, 2018):  
> Fertility was procyclical but declined and delayed with long-run growth; fluctuations late (but not early) in the reproductive period affected lifetime fertility.

3. The mystery of the origins of modern growth

**Needham Puzzle:**
Why didn't China have a scientific revolution considering its early scientific accomplishments?

**Great Divergence(Pomeranz):**
- Why did the Industrial Revolution occur in Europe?
   - Why did the Industrial Revolution not occur in China?
- Why did the Industrial Revolution occur in the 18th century?
   - Why didn't China achieve a breakthrough around the same time as Europe?

- Big question (“Great Divergence”): Why was Europe first in achieving modern economic growth?
- Small question (“Little Divergence”): Why, within Europe, was Britain first?

Three popular answers to “Why Britain?”
1. Good institutions, in particular after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 (Acemoglu and Robinson).
2. Scientific/technological innovations created by a “culture of growth” (Joel Mokyr).
3. High wages created by international trade and urbanization induced technological innovation (Robert Allen).
