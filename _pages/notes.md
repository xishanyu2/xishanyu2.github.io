I intend to update a series of study notes regarding mathematical and computational methodologies associated with economic research. The prospective topics are as follows:

01 Linear Algebra (start from column space of matrix A)  
02 Stata and Python (Programming and Visualization)  
03 Intermediate Econometrics (in matrix form)  
04 Spacial Econometrics  
05 Social Network Analysis  
06 Text Analysis  
07 Machine Learning  
08 Deep Learning

Although I am extremely intrigued in next subjects, owing to the difficulties, I am anticipating to gain insight and arrange them in the near future.  
09 Advanced International Trade  
10 Mathematical Political Economy
