Welcome to my personal homepage! I'm Zhenyu Zhao, a first-year master’s student specializing in World Economy at the Nankai Institute of International Economics. I deeply believe that knowledge gains its true value when shared. That’s exactly why this website exists: it’s not just a platform, but a personal corner where I can dive into learning, keep track of my growth, and share the insights I’ve gathered along the way.
