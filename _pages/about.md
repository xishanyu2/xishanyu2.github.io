Welcome to my personal academic homepage! I'm Zhenyu Zhao, a fourth grade undergraduate student at [Nankai University](https://www.nankai.edu.cn/). I have obtained the qualification for postgraduate recommendation from [Nankai Institute of International Economics](https://nkiie.nankai.edu.cn/main.htm), majoring in World Economy. I couldn't agree more with the idea that knowledge should be shared. This website is used for academic communication and sharing and I hope it will improve my writing skills.
