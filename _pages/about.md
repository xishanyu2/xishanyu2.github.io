Welcome to my personal homepage! I'm Zhenyu Zhao, a first-year master’s student specializing in World Economy at [Nankai Institute of International Economics](https://nkiie.nankai.edu.cn/main.htm). I deeply believe that knowledge gains its true value when shared. That’s exactly why this website exists: it’s not just a platform, but my own little corner where I can dive into learning, keep track of my growth, and share the insights I’ve gathered along the way.
